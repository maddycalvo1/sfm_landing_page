        <p>
          Welcome to the SetForMarriage Privacy Policy! This explains how we
          collect, store, protect, and share your information, and with whom we
          share it. We suggest you read this in conjunction with our Terms and
          Conditions of Use. Whilst you&#39;re enjoying the SetForMarriage
          mobile application (&quot;App&quot;), we collect some information
          about you. In addition, you may choose to use the App to share
          information with other members on the app, including your friends and
          contacts (&quot;Users&quot;). We may also need to share your
          information sometimes.
        </p>
        <p>
          SetForMarriage is a global app, and your information will be sent to
          and used in the United States regardless of the country you reside in.
          This Policy explains how we protect your personal data when we
          transfer it overseas, so please read very carefully! If you have any
          questions or comments about this Policy, please feel free to contact
          us at
          <a href="mailto:Support@SetForMarriage.com"

        </p>
        <h3>1. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h3>
        <h4>Registration Information</h4>
        <p>
          When you download the App and create an account (&quot;Account&quot;),
          we may collect certain information (&quot;Registration
          Information&quot;) about you, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Name;</li>
          <li>Username;</li>
          <li>Email address;</li>
          <li>Gender identity;</li>
          <li>Date of birth;</li>
          <li>Sexual preference;</li>
          <li>Photographs;</li>
          <li>Location; and</li>
          <li>
            You will also be required to create a password in connection with
            the registration of your Account. Once you register, you will be
            able to review and change this information at any time by accessing
            your “Profile” page! You control your user profile and are able to
            correct or update (other than your email address, date of birth,
            gender and location (which is automatically updated)) your
            information at any time by just logging in to SetForMarriage.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The information we collect helps to enhance the App and verify our
          Users (robots are not welcome!!). Registration Information such as
          your First name may be visible to the public on your profile page.
        </p>
        <h4>Additional Information</h4>
        <p>
          We may ask you to provide your full name, address and email address.
          Such details may be shared with third parties for purposes relating
          to, for example, any of our loyalty programs, sending gifts or
          delivery of merchandise.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also collect additional information in connection with your use
          of SetForMarriage, for example if you use our messaging platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you contact our Customer Support team, we will receive your email
          address, and may track your IP address as well as the information you
          send to us to help resolve your query. We will keep records of our
          communications with you, including any complaints that we receive from
          you about other Users (and from other Users about you).
        </p>
        <p>
          We recommend and encourage you (and all our members) to think
          carefully about the information you disclose about yourself. We also
          do not recommend that you put email addresses, URLs, instant messaging
          details, phone numbers, full names or addresses, credit card details,
          national identity numbers, drivers&#39; license details and other
          sensitive information on your profile which is open to abuse and
          misuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on
          your profile such as your religious denomination and health details.
          You may also choose to add sensitive information about yourself when
          you update the Bio form on your SetForMarriage profile, such as your
          religion and political leanings. While you may voluntarily provide
          this information to us when you create your profile, including your
          sexual preferences, there is no requirement to do so. Please remember
          that photographs that you post on SetForMarriage may reveal
          information about yourself as well. Where you do upload and choose to
          tell us sensitive information about yourself, including through adding
          text and photos to your profile, you are explicitly consenting to our
          processing of your information and making this public to other users.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you post information about yourself or use the messaging
          function, the amount of personal information you share is at your own
          risk. Please see Section 4 below for more information on who can
          access what you post on SetForMarriage. If you post anything that is
          inconsistent with our Terms and Conditions of Use, we reserve the
          right to terminate your Account - we really don&#39;t want to have to
          do this so please play by the rules!
        </p>
        <p>
          For safety and security and to ensure you have the best possible user
          experience, we require users to verify their accounts and might ask
          for your phone number. We want to make sure you are not a robot! And
          we also want to avoid fake SetForMarriage accounts being created which
          can be used for malicious activities and cybercrime – they threaten
          the SetForMarriage network and spoil things for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is your responsibility to ensure that your account details are kept
          up to date. If your email address changes, please ensure that you
          update this in your account.
        </p>
        <p>
          To prevent abuse of the app/site, SetForMarriage uses automated
          decisions and moderators to block accounts as part of its moderation
          procedures. In order to do this, we check accounts and messages for
          content that indicates breaches of our Terms and Conditions of Use.
          This is done through a combination of automated systems and our team
          of moderators. If an account or message meets certain criteria that
          demonstrate that the Terms and Conditions of Use are likely to have
          been breached, the relevant account will automatically be blocked. All
          users of accounts that have been blocked will be notified that their
          account has been blocked and affected users can contact SetForMarriage
          to contest the decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          SetForMarriage also uses automated decisions to prevent fraudulent
          payment transactions being processed as part of its anti-fraud
          procedures. In order to do this, our systems check payment
          transactions for behavior that indicates breaches of our Terms and
          Conditions of Use. If a transaction meets certain criteria that
          demonstrate that the Terms and Conditions of Use are likely to have
          been breached and the transaction is likely to be fraudulent, the
          relevant transaction may automatically be blocked. Where a transaction
          is blocked, the user will be notified that their transaction cannot be
          processed and affected users can contact SetForMarriage to contest the
          decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          For users who are California residents, the data we may collect falls
          within the following categories of “personal information,” as defined
          by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identifiers, such as name and location;</li>
          <li>
            Personal information, as defined in the California customer records
            law, such as contact (including email and telephone number) and
            financial information;
          </li>
          <li>
            Characteristics of protected classifications under California or
            federal law (if you choose to provide them), such as age, gender
            identity, marital status, sexual orientation, race, ancestry,
            national origin, religion, and medical conditions;
          </li>
          <li>
            Commercial information, such as transaction information and purchase
            history;
          </li>
          <li>Biometric information (not relevant here);</li>
          <li>
            Internet or network activity information, such as browsing history
            and interactions with our websites and apps;
          </li>
          <li>Geolocation data, such as mobile device location;</li>
          <li>
            Audio, electronic, visual and similar information, such as photos

          </li>
          <li>
            Professional or employment-related information, such as work history
            and prior employer;
          </li>
          <li>Non-public education information; and</li>
          <li>
            Inferences drawn from any of the personal information listed above
            to create a profile or summary about, for example, an individual’s
            preferences and characteristics.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Data Storage</h4>
        <p>
          By using the App, you acknowledge that SetForMarriage is a global app
          operating through servers located in a number of countries around the
          world, including the United States. If you live in a country with data
          protection laws, the storage of your personal data may not provide you
          with the same protections as you enjoy in your country of residence.
        </p>
        <h4>Geolocation Information</h4>
        <p>
          If you turn these features on, when you use your mobile, we will
          collect information about WiFi access points as well as other location
          information about your longitude and latitude and may save your
          device&#39;s coordinates to offer certain features to you. This
          information helps us identify your physical location and we may use it
          to personalize the App and make it easier for you to interact with
          other Users, by enabling the information to be displayed and shared
          with other members choosing to view “nearby” posts.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have enabled location services, but wish to turn them off, you
          can do so by the following methods:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            iPhone app — settings, privacy, location services, SetForMarriage
          </li>
          <li>
            Android — settings, location, SetForMarriage, permissions, location
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Log and Usage Data</h4>
        <p>
          We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for
          legitimate business purposes (as set out in Section 11 below) and as
          permitted by applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, we delete or anonymize your information upon deletion of
          your account (following the safety retention window), unless:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, some
            “traffic data” is kept for one year to comply with statutory data
            retention obligations);
          </li>
          <li>
            we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for
            instance, records of consents to our Terms, Privacy Policy and other
            similar consents are kept for five years);
          </li>
          <li>
            there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep
            the relevant information until it is resolved; or
          </li>
          <li>
            the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests,
            such as fraud prevention and enhancing users&#39; safety and
            security. For example, information may need to be kept to prevent a
            user who was banned for unsafe behavior or security incidents from
            opening a new account.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Where SetForMarriage uses machine learning, for example, to help us
          detect and prevent fraudulent card transactions, and to detect and
          prevent spam communications on the App (as explained above), we may
          need to keep personal information for a longer period than the
          retention periods explained above, to enable the machine learning to
          work properly. Where this is the case, we always seek to minimize the
          amount of personal information that is used and we ensure that it is
          ring- fenced and kept securely from other user personal information.
          We regularly review the period for which personal information is
          required for machine learning purposes and delete any identifiable
          information when it is no longer required.
        </p>
        <h4>Device Information</h4>
        <p>
          We may collect information about your device when you use the App
          including the unique device identifier, device model, operating
          system, and MAC address. In addition, if you permit us to do so, the
          App may access your device&#39;s address book solely in order to add
          someone to your contacts.
        </p>
        <h4>Links</h4>
        <p>
          We may keep track of how you interact with links available on
          SetForMarriage including third party services and clients by
          redirecting clicks or through other means. We may share aggregate
          click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked
          on.
        </p>
        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        <p>
          Unlike the chocolate chip kind, these cookies have no calories! They
          are small data files that are transferred to your computer&#39;s hard
          disk and are basically a tool that stores information about website

          SetForMarriage, and ensures site functionality and enables us to
          provide the services our members request.

        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          If for any reason you decide that you do not want all of your
          SetForMarriage activities to be stored you may set your browser and
          mobile settings to block cookies and local storage devices, but please
          remember that if you do so, you may not be able to access all of the
