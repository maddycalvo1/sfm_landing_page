      <h1>What We Value</h1>

      <h2 class="pt-30">Integrity</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          This is perhaps the strongest and most foundational of our values.
          We want you to know just exactly how much we value the awesome
          institution of marriage. We are not here to make a quick buck. We
          know that the only way you will let us become your trusted resource
          for all things marriage, is if we are consistent in doing right by
          our members. And that means holding true to our values, and not
          selling out to easy profits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most sites are focused only on you as a single person. And that's
          really how they want you to stay - SINGLE! As soon as you enter into
          a serious relationship, they've lost you as a paying customer. They
          may brag about how many marriages they've fostered, but the
          accounting department considers it bad news!
        </p>
        <p>
          At SETforMARRIAGE.com, we mean what we say. Marriage is awesome! We
          love it when marriages happen. We don't care what our account
          department says. We want to be known, first and foremost, as the
          site that is truly all about the awesomeness of marriage. And you
          will know it by our actions. If we're successful with that, the rest
          takes care of itself.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="pt-30">Respect</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          We respect all types and all nationalities. Everyone deserves a
          partner for life that is ready for the commitment of marriage.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also expect the same from our SETforMARRIAGE communities. The
          only intolerance we show is for those that seek to belittle, or
          start unnecessary arguments.
        </p>
        <p>
          We respect your intelligence level, too. We go out of our way to
          provide intelligent resources, and solid advice from leaders who
          think like we do. We don't pander, nor do the things that other
          sites do to make a fast buck. You'll know that we respect you and
          your IQ without us having to tell you.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, we think you're a genius. We love it that you're here and
          not in a bar, or worse, faking your way through church to score your
          next date.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="pt-30">Positivity</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          We are here to show love and encouragement. We want to help you find
          that person that you are seeking to spend the rest of your life
          with, regardless of your particular walk of life and where you're
          from. We feel we give you the best chance at that. Love is an active
          decision to put others first. And you are first in our book. We love
          it that you want to be a part of SETforMARRIAGE.com. We want your
          experience to be awesome so that your marriage is awesome.
        </p>
        <p>
          Positivity also means fun. We have many ways for you to meet that
          special someone. And many more fun ways that are in the works.
          Dating is fun. Online dating should be way more fun than not. It
          shouldn't be like flipping through a book of house listings that
          never change. It should be energizing, dynamic, comfortable and yet,
          highly interactive.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="pt-30">Commitment</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Dating, Engagements and Weddings do not end our relationship with
          our members. We are offering as much in-depth support, community and
          resources post-wedding as we do pre-wedding. We don't just sign you
          up and turn on the auto-pilot, secretly hoping you never find "the
          one."
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to help prepare and support you as you spend the rest of
          your life with that person. When you join SETforMARRIAGE.com, we
          stick with you for the long haul. And we're constantly building
          improvements and nurturing communities on our site to prove that.
