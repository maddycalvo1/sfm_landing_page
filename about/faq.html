        <h4 class="pt-30">
          How is SETforMARRIAGE.com different from other dating sites?
        </h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            We are looking for only one kind of member - the person (at least 18
            years old) who is ready to find their potential spouse. Someone who
            is <em>set for marriage</em> (clever, huh?).
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="pt-30">
          Aren't all online dating sites for people who want to get married?
        </h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            No! Most sites are focused only on you as a single person. And thats
            really how they want you to stay - SINGLE! As soon as you enter into
            a serious relationship, theyve lost you as a paying customer. They
            may brag about how many marriages theyve fostered, but the
            accounting department considers it bad news!
          </p>
          <p>
            We want to equip you to not only find THE ONE, we want to help
            prepare and support you as you spend the rest of your life with that
            person. When you join SETforMARRIAGE.com, we stick with you for the
            long haul. And were constantly building improvements and nurturing
            communities on our site to prove that.
          </p>
          <p>
            At SETforMARRIAGE.com, we mean what we say. Marriage is awesome! We
            love it when marriages happen. We don't care what our account
            department says. We want to be known, first and foremost, as the
            site that is truly all about the awesomeness of marriage. If we're
            successful with that, the rest takes care of itself.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="pt-30">Is your site open to same-sex marriage?</h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            Yes. If same-sex marriages are legal in your country, and a
            committed same-sex marriage is what you are seeking; we want to be
            there to help. We are a site of encouragement, grace, and freedom
            (see next question, below).
          </p>
          <p>
            We have various points of view among those in our senior staff. That
            being said, we are singularly committed to showing encouragement and
            grace. Not prejudice. We do not pre-judge. We are here to show love
            to all, and to show the best attributes of our points of view.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="pt-30">
          Is this site specifically a Christian marriage site?
        </h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            No. But as referenced in the question above, we are also strong
            believers of freedom. And that means freedom of religion expression.
            For example, we may show a strong Christian point of view at
            particular times, but we're not here to initiate or support debates.
            And we don't make it policy to express our (or our contributor's)
            religious beliefs if it means being intolerant, judgmental or
            belittling. There is plenty of that in cyberspace already. We
            believe in ALWAYS striving to put our best foot forward in terms of
            grace, love and encouragement (and that includes all beliefs). We
            have no problem with any belief system being represented when it is
            promoting and encouraging awesome marriages and not pitting itself
            against another belief system.
          </p>
          <p>
            That being said, if the very nature of the religious expression draw
            your ire and your reactions show any hint of intolerance, prejudice,
            or belittling, then we will remove or hide your comments. It's that
            simple. There is nothing forcing you to participate. But why not
            soak it in, regardless? You never know - there might be a small
            nugget of wisdom that you would've otherwise missed out on. A wise
            person can learn from any situation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="pt-30">
          You mention "Dynamic Interaction" on your site. What is that?
        </h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            <em>Dynamic Interaction</em> is an approach unique to
            SETforMARRIAGE.com. It's about our members what most dating sites
            cannot - the ability to see a member's personality come out{' '}
            <em>dynamically</em> and yet, casually. You see, other dating sites
            show you a list of profiles. And really there's not much else that
            might allow you to become more familiar with them in a passive
            setting - to learn their sense of humor, or to see how they respond
            beyond what they've put up on their profile page. You might as well
            be looking at real estate listings.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our site has built-in methods for you to see their personality come
            out dynamically, without making a huge leap into their personal
            space. Not only is this similar to how the offline world works, but
            it is also very similar to the way that popular social media sites
            work. With our built-in ability to allow members to have followers,
            you can interact without being exclusive. They (your followers) can
            see you post about the same sorts of things that you would post on
            sites like Facebook or Twitter.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="pt-30">
          What does it mean to "Follow" someone, and how to I do it?
        </h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            Following someone means you are interested enough in getting to know
            them that you want to be in the loop of their activity. You can
            follow a member by clicking the Follow button on the member's
            profile, and on your News Feed, you will have the ability to receive
            notifications each time this member updates their status or adds a
            new photo (and that's just the beginning!). You also do not need
            their consent (though they have the ability to "Hide" you). You are
            simply showing interest.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="pt-30">What is a "Wink"?</h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            A "Wink" is a way to let someone know they caught your eye. You can
            send someone a wink by clicking the Wink button on their profile.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="pt-30">What is the News Feed?</h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            Similar to other social media sites, like Facebook, our News Feed
            gives you the ability to see comments and posts from the members
            that you follow, members in your search criteria, and news
            exclusively from SETforMARRIAGE.com - all according to your
            preferences. You even have the ability to "Like" or "Comment" on
            posts WITHOUT having to be directly connected to them.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="pt-30">
          Can I hide a member if I don't want them to "Follow" me?
        </h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            Absolutely. We want this to be a positive experience for you. Just
            click the "Hide" link on the members' profile page, or underneath
            their posts, or comments. We make it easy.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="pt-30">
          If I "Like" or comment on someone's post that I'm interested in, won't
          other members (my rivals, perhaps) also see my "Likes" and comments?
        </h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            Definitely not. When you comment on someone's post, it sends that person a direct message from you
            showing your comment and post reference in the Chat. There is never a reason for two members interested in 
            the same person to see each other's comments or "Likes" directed toward the same person.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="pt-30">Can I restrict who sees my posts?</h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            We give you the ability to block anyone you choose and they will not see your posts. 
            With that said, you never know who may LOL at that amazingly clever post of yours, or that photo of you showing off your cooking skills (you'll thank us when you catch the unexpected eye of a fellow foodie!).
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="pt-30">What if I want to interact more directly?</h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            You can send private messages very easily through the App. From there - well, you're on your own. 
            Although, you might want to check our IG and Facebook page for some nifty dating tips! 
          </p>
        </div>


        <h4 class="pt-30">
          Hmmm - something doesn't seem right about this profile - could it be
          fake?
        </h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            It happens in the online dating world. A lot. We have many filtering
            technologies built into the site, but these buggers still keep
            slipping through. Please report them through the app and we'll review profile
            as quickly as possible.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="pt-30">
          On the search page, there is something called "Saved Search"
          What is this and why should I care?
        </h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            Your Saved search is the search criteria that you have selected and have designated as your main (or ideal) criteria. This is helpful most specifically in regards to who and what you see in your Search results and also saves you time of not having to reset your search parameters every time you wish to do a search.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="pt-30">
          This seems an awful lot like Instagram? I'm already on Instagram - why
          do I need ANOTHER social media site in my life?
        </h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            That's a very relevant question. And here is an equally relevant
            answer… Because looking for love is a big chunk of the social scene
            for a single person who is actively looking. Trust us - you want to
            have this as a major part of your online social network. And it's
            okay that it's separate from your Facebook and Instagram worlds. Sure
            there are relationships that Facebook is responsible for fostering.
            But for really focusing your attention towards ONLY those who are
            ALSO looking for their potential spouse… we cannot be beat.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="pt-30">
          What is the difference between a free membership and a subscription?
        </h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            A <em>free membership</em> includes: * Ability to customize a free
            profile page with your photos, Likes, and Interests. * Ability to
            search through existing profiles, including pictures * Ability to
            send unlimited winks * Ability to save your favorite searches *
            Ability to Follow members and receive updates on their activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <em>paid subscription</em> includes all of the above features
            plus: * Ability to send a direct communication to another member 
          </p>
        </div>


        <h4 class="pt-30">
          I cancelled my account and want to re-activate. Do I have to create a
          whole new profile or is my information saved?
        </h4>
        <div>
          <p>
            When your Account is deactivated, we take reasonable efforts to make sure it is no longer viewable on the App. For up to 30 days it is still possible to restore your Account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.
            After 30 days, we begin the process of deleting your Account from our systems.
             We are not responsible for any information, pictures, comments, or other content that is deleted from our systems resulting from the deactivation of your Account.
