				<h3>Subscriptions; Charges on Your Billing Account
				</h3>
				<h4>Billing and Payment
				</h4>
				<p>SETforMARRIAGE.com bills you through an online account (your "Billing Account") for use of the
					Service. You agree to pay SETforMARRIAGE.com all charges at the prices you agreed to for any use of
					the Service by you or other persons (including your agents) using your Billing Account, and you
					authorize SETforMARRIAGE.com to charge your chosen payment provider (your "Payment Method") for the
					Service. You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. SETforMARRIAGE.com may
					correct any billing errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received
					payment. This Section 12 includes any agreements you made with SETforMARRIAGE.com on the Website
					when becoming a Member or subscribing to the Service. The terms of your payment will be based on
					your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution,
					credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If you initiate a chargeback or
					otherwise reverse a payment made with your Payment Method, we may in our discretion terminate your
					account immediately. If we successfully dispute the reversal, and the reversed funds are returned to
					us, you are not entitled to a refund or to have your account or subscription reinstated.
				</p>
				<h4>Automatic Renewal
				</h4>
				<p>Your subscription will continue indefinitely until cancelled by you. After your initial subscription
					commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will
					automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when
					subscribing. You agree that your account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature. If you
					do not wish your account to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your
					subscription, please log in and go to the Change / Cancel Membership (or similar) page on your
					Account Settings page. If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end
					of your then-current subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed after your
					then-current term expires. However, you won’t be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of
					the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period. By subscribing, you authorize
					SETforMARRIAGE.com to charge your Payment Method now and again at the beginning of any subsequent
					subscription period. You also authorize SETforMARRIAGE.com to charge you for any sales or similar
					taxes that may be imposed on your subscription payments. Upon the renewal of your subscription, if
					SETforMARRIAGE.com does not receive payment from your Payment Method provider, (i) you agree to pay
					all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand, and/or (ii) you agree that SETforMARRIAGE.com
					may either terminate or suspend your subscription and continue to attempt to charge your Payment
					Method provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your account will be activated
					and for purposes of automatic renewal, your new subscription commitment period will begin as of the
					day payment was received).
				</p>
				<h4>Current Information
				</h4>
				<p>You must provide current, complete and accurate information for your Billing Account. You must
					promptly update all information to keep your Billing Account current, complete and accurate (such as
					a change in billing address, card number or expiration date), and you must promptly notify
					SETforMARRIAGE.com if your Payment Method is canceled (including if you lose your card or it is
					stolen), or if you become aware of a potential breach of security (such as an unauthorized
					disclosure or use of your name or password). Changes to such information can be made at Account
					Settings on the Website. If you fail to provide SETforMARRIAGE.com any of the foregoing information,
					you agree that you are responsible for fees accrued under your Billing Account. In addition, you
					authorize us to obtain updated or replacement expiration dates and card numbers for you credit or
					debit card as provided by your credit or debit card issuer.
				</p>
				<h4>Reaffirmation of Authorization
				</h4>
				<p>Your non-termination or continued use of the Service reaffirms that SETforMARRIAGE.com is authorized
					to charge your Payment Method. SETforMARRIAGE.com may submit those charges for payment and you will
					be responsible for such charges. This does not waive SETforMARRIAGE.com's right to seek payment
					directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise
					described when you initially subscribed to the Service.
				</p>
				<h4>Free Trials and Other Promotions
				</h4>
				<p>Any free trial or other promotion that provides subscriber-level access to the Service must be used
					within the specified time of the trial. You must cancel your subscription before the end of the
					trial period in order to avoid being charged a subscription fee. If you cancel prior to the end of
					the trial period and are inadvertently charged for a subscription, please contact Customer Care to
					have the charges reversed.</p>

				<h3>Arbitration and Governing Law
				</h3>
				<h4>Arbitration Agreement
				</h4>
				<p>The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement
					(including
					any alleged breach thereof), the Service, or the Website shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered
					by the
					American Arbitration Association. The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you
					have the
					right to bring an individual claim against SETforMARRIAGE.com in a small-claims court of competent
					jurisdiction. But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any
					circumstances
					commence or maintain against SETforMARRIAGE.com any class action, class arbitration, or other
					representative
					action or proceeding.
				</p>
				<h4>Notice of Rights
				</h4>
				<p>By using the Website or the Service in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In
					doing so,
					YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and
					SETforMARRIAGE.com
					(except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO
					PARTICIPATE IN
					A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your rights will be determined by a *NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR,
					NOT A
					JUDGE OR JURY. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant
					any relief
					that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more
					streamlined
					than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and
					may be
					overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For details on the arbitration process, see our
					Arbitration Procedures.
				</p>
				<h4>Court Proceedings
				</h4>
				<p>Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or
					vacate
					an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that
					this
					arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against
					SETforMARRIAGE.com
					(except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located
					in
					Harris County, Texas. You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such
					purposes.
				</p>
				<h4>Governing Law
				</h4>
				<p>This Agreement, and any dispute between you and SETforMARRIAGE.com, shall be governed by the laws of
					the
					state of Texas without regard to principles of conflicts of law, provided that this arbitration
					agreement
					shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
				</p>
				<h3>Indemnity by You
				</h3>
				<p>
					You agree to indemnify and hold SETforMARRIAGE.com, its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents,
					and
					other partners and employees, harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including
					reasonable
					attorney's fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your use of the Service in
					violation of
					this Agreement and/or arising from a breach of this Agreement and/or any breach of your
					representations and
					warranties set forth above.
				</p>
				<h3>No Third Party Beneficiaries

					the
					Website and/or the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of
					this
					Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. This Agreement is subject to change by
					SETforMARRIAGE.com
					at any time. If you are a non-subscribing Member at the time of any change, the revised terms will
					be
					effective upon posting on the SETforMARRIAGE.com website and your use of the Service after such
					posting will
					constitute acceptance by you of the revised Agreement. If you are a subscribing Member at the time
					of any
					change, this Agreement will continue to govern your membership until such time that you renew your
					subscription as contemplated by Section 12. If you continue your subscription, your renewal will
					constitute
					acceptance by you of the revised Agreement. Alternatively, if you terminate your subscription at
